# HTTP Protocol, JSON and API's

This cla will first recap on how the internet actually works. 

We will look at GET request and POST request

Once we understand the difference then we will look at what an API is?

Then we will call an API, using GET and POST request and get back on JSON

We will also look what JSON is

## HTTP GET and POST

[ADD PICTURE HERE]

GET and POST are both requests.

### GET
Has a user with path + arguments. Also takes metadata and headers. 

### POST
Has all the above JSON + XML

## JSON - JavaScrip Object Notation

JSON is basically a dictionary in JavaScript


## API - Application Programing Interface
Its an application or a program that the user interacts with.

Where an old rotating telephone thing where you select the number is an good
for humans but it is not appropriate for machines.

API is the right interface for SERVERS to talk to SERVERS.

Basically it exposes a service in a standardized way using JSON

Examples:
- get access to a database (postcode.io, TFL)
- get access to a service (twillio, google image recognition)
- and many others

## CALLING API with GET

## CALLING API with POST + JSON

## Interpreting JSON into a dictionary (So We Can Use Is)

## Creating a JSON (from a dictionary or a string)
